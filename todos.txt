html/css (card slots) for 
tableau piles (z-axis needed, 7 of these, 13 levels each) 
foundation piles (four of these)
stock pile, waste pile (one card each)

cardslot (visibility attribute, become hidden when there's not a card here)
^^ need 13 of these on each slot

js stuff -- add event listeners for: (FSM/DFA-like in terms of possible transitions)
stock -> to waste
waste -> to foundation or tableau
tableau -> to separate column or foundation
